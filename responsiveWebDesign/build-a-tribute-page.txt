          <p>"I am tendon-strong.
             Muscles alone won’t hold horses back. Tendons will – and do. But they must be cultivated. Oh, yes. They must be developed. There is a way of increasing their strength, and that way, I claim in all modesty, I have perfected. Real, sound, and efficient is my method."</p>
